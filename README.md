## How to get Started ;-)
Hi there, lets start by making a directory where we will work on. 
Simply Open your terminal and then:
```
mkdir myDiary && cd myDiary
```

## Create a Python Virtual Environment for our Project
Since we are using Python 3, create a virtual environment called `venv` by typing:
```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```
Before we install our project's Python requirements, we need to activate the virtual environment. You can do that by typing:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Clone and Configure a New Django Project
Login into your github account and open the project folder then follow the instruction on how to clone the existing project. It should be something similar to:
```
git clone https://<github_account>@github.org/<your_github_username>/My-Diary-V1.git
```
Next, install the requirements by typing:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
